		<p>With the discoveries of the proton in 1911 by Rutherford and the neutron in 1932 by Chadwick, the physicists 
		could understand better and better the constituents of matter. These two particles are the two building blocks 
		of the atomic nucleus which corresponds to essentially all the visible mass in the universe. Protons and neutrons 
		(the nucleons) are the bound states at lowest energy of baryons composed of quarks and gluons. 
		Through the strong interaction, the nucleons can interact and sometimes they can form together bound states of nuclei. 
		In nuclear physics we consider the nucleon as structureless elementary particle. This is justified because 
		in the low-energy region the nucleons hardly get excited. Then we can understand the properties of the nuclear 
		many-body system thanks to the nucleon-nucleon interaction. To understand the low-energy properties, a lot of nuclei 
		are at our disposal to study. Indeed we count 288 stable nuclei on earth in the valley of stability but thousands of 
		them (around 6000) that are unstable exist in the universe situated between the drip-lines, which define the limit 
		of existence. This instability is due to an excess of protons or neutrons. We can today produce a lot of radioactive 
		nuclei in our laboratories. In the figure below the nuclear chart is presented, which is the playground of the nuclear 
		physicist. We are very interested to access nuclei with an abnormal ratio of neutrons over protons N/Z to understand
		the evolution of the nuclear interaction. We call these nuclei exotic nuclei.  These exotic nuclei can show unexpected 
		behavior by comparison to the stable ones: for instance the evolution of shells with the appearance of new magic numbers
		as it was experimentally shown recently in the neutron-rich calcium isotopes with the new magic numbers N=32, 
		these phenomena of shell evolutions are also well studied theoretically where theoreticians point out the appearance 
		of new magic numbers; the halo nuclei are also a well known example of unexpected behavior with their neutron skins 
		and their huge spatial distribution. This is why there is nowadays a huge effort both experimentally and theoretically 
		to understand these behaviors and to constrain the evolution of the nuclear structure. Different experimental techniques
		are at our disposal to study the accessible nuclei and pin down the nuclear forces at stakes: among them the beta-decay 
		study to measure the level scheme and branching ratio as the beta-decay time of flight for instance, or in general 
		manner the collision between nuclei that can lead to different processes such as the elastic scattering, the inelastic 
		reaction, the transfer reaction where one or few nucleons are exchanged between the beam and the target or the fusion to
		form a compound nucleus. Direct reaction such as the pick-up reaction are an important tool in nuclear physics because 
		this kind of reaction probes the single-particle character of the states in a nucleus. That's why, when it is possible, 
		direct reactions are a very interesting tool to probe the shell evolution at the extreme of isospin. </p>
		<p>In this thesis, we are particularly interested in the proton-shell evolution in neutron-rich Copper isotopes between N=40 to N=50 toward 
		the doubly-magic <SUP>78</SUP>Ni nucleus. In this manuscript, we shall focus on the proton-hole states along the isotopic chain of
		Copper, in particular in <SUP>69</SUP>Cu and <SUP>71</SUP>Cu. Indeed, proton-hole states in Copper isotopes are very interesting to probe the 
		Z=28 gap and that will be studied through the (d,<SUP>3</SUP>He) proton pick-up reaction. In a first part we explain the motivations
		and the experimental procedure to study these two nuclei, during the second part we describe the experimental setup and 
		the data analysis for <SUP>69</SUP>Cu while the third part is devoted to the <SUP>71</SUP>Cu nucleus and finally in the last part we present
		the interpretation of the results.</p>
